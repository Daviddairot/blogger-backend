# **Blogger Project Overview**

The **Blogger** project implements essential CRUD (**Create, Read, Update, and Delete**) operations with **MongoDB**, providing functionalities such as:

- Creating posts
- Retrieving all posts
- Deleting posts
- Updating posts
- mongoDB

This implementation is both simple and highly functional, making it a great foundation for understanding or extending CRUD operations in a **Node.js** environment.

This README will guide you through downloading, setting up, and integrating the code into your own project.
